# Election-of-candidates

## Abstract
We tried to create a system that doesn’t
entirely replace the current voting but rather
integrates within a current system. We
decided to do this to allow for as many ways
to vote as possible, this is so voting can be
accessed by most of the population. So, we
have created a code in C language for electing
a candidate. Hence by this way we created
solution for this problem. Democratic voting is
a crucial and serious event in any country. The
most common way in which a country votes is
through a paper-based system. But consider
that introducing e-voting systems with the
aim of improving various aspects of the
electoral process

## Introduction
Our project is about E voting system .While
elections are conducting, to avoid risk of
casting illegal votes this E voting process is
useful. Through this process there is no need
of printing paper ballots to cast vote.
The standardization or adoption of such E
voting system would be a step towards public
approval of electronic voting schemes,
provided that the said E voting system is
secure and has been tested and tried. The
release of new protocols, with security issues
does not take steps to progress in public
approval and, ultimately, replacement of the
paper elections

## Objective
The Aim of this project is building trust in electoral 
management, adding credibility to election results 
and increasing the overall efficiency of the 
electoral process. By this project we can count and
Store data of votes casted for the respective 
candidate. Our main Objective is to make voting 
procedure flexible for every voter.
